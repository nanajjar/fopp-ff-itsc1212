  <title>Lists are Mutable</title>
  <p>Unlike strings, lists are <term>mutable</term>.  This means we can change an item in a list by accessing
            it directly as part of the assignment statement. Using the indexing operator (square brackets) on the left side of an assignment, we can
            update one of the list items.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceMutability_1" label="ac_sequenceMutability_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
fruit = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]
print(fruit)

fruit[0] = "pear"
fruit[-1] = "orange"
print(fruit)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>An
            assignment to an element of a list is called <term>item assignment</term>. Item
            assignment does not work for strings.  Recall that strings are immutable.</p>
  <p>Here is the same example in codelens so that you can step through the statements and see the changes to the list elements.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceMutability_2" label="ac_sequenceMutability_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
fruit = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]

fruit[0] = "pear"
fruit[-1] = "orange"
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>By combining assignment with the slice operator we can update several elements at once.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceMutability_3" label="ac_sequenceMutability_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
alist[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
print(alist)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>We can also remove elements from a list by assigning the empty list to them.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceMutability_4" label="ac_sequenceMutability_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
alist[1:3] = []
print(alist)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>We can even insert elements into a list by squeezing them into an empty slice at the
            desired location.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceMutability_5" label="ac_sequenceMutability_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
alist = ['a', 'd', 'f']
alist[1:1] = ['b', 'c']
print(alist)
alist[4:4] = ['e']
print(alist)
    </input>
  </program>

<subsection xml:id="strings_strings-are-immutable">
    <title>Strings are Immutable</title>
  <p>One important thing that makes strings different from some other Python collection types is that
            you are not allowed to modify the individual characters in the collection.  It is tempting to use the <c>[]</c> operator on the left side of an assignment,
            with the intention of changing a character in a string.  For example, in the following code, we would like to change the first letter of <c>greeting</c>.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceMutability_6" label="ac_sequenceMutability_6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
greeting = "Hello, world!"
greeting[0] = 'J'            # ERROR!
print(greeting)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Instead of producing the output <c>Jello, world!</c>, this code produces the
            runtime error <c>TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment</c>.</p>
  <p>Strings are <term>immutable</term>, which means you cannot change an existing string. The
            best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceMutability_7" label="ac_sequenceMutability_7" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
greeting = "Hello, world!"
newGreeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
print(newGreeting)
print(greeting)            # same as it was
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The solution here is to concatenate a new first letter onto a slice of
            <c>greeting</c>. This operation has no effect on the original string.</p>

<subsection xml:id="transforming-sequences_tuples-are-immutable">
    <title>Tuples are Immutable</title>
    <p>As with strings, if we try to use item assignment to modify one of the elements of a tuple, we get an error. In fact, that's the key difference between lists and tuples: tuples are like immutable lists. None of the operations on lists that mutate them are available for tuples. Once a tuple is created, it can't be changed.</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
julia[0] = 'X'  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</input>
