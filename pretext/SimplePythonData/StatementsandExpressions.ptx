  <title>Statements and Expressions</title>
  <!--<video xml:id="expression_vid" youtube="3WgmLIsXFkI" width="auto"/>-->
  <p>A <term>statement</term> is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We
            have only seen the assignment statement so far.  Some other kinds of statements
            that we'll see shortly are <c>while</c> statements, <c>for</c> statements, <c>if</c>
            statements,  and <c>import</c> statements.  (There are other kinds too!)</p>
  <p xml:id="simple-python-data_index-0">An <term>expression</term> is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls
            to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. 
            The result of evaluating an expression is a <em>
    value</em> or <em>object</em>.</p>

           <p> If you ask Python to <c>print</c> an expression, the interpreter
            <term>evaluates</term> the expression and displays the result.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_statementsAndExpressions_1" label="ac_statementsAndExpressions_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(1 + 1)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The <em>evaluation of an expression</em> produces a value, which is why expressions
            can appear on the right hand side of assignment statements. A value all by
            itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable.  Evaluating a variable gives the value that the variable refers to.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_statementsAndExpressions_2" label="ac_statementsAndExpressions_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
y = 3.14
print(y)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>If we take a look at this same example in the Python shell, we will see one of the distinct differences between statements and expressions.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 3.14
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(y)
3.14
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
3.14
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Note that when we enter the assignment statement, <c>y = 3.14</c>, only the prompt is returned.  There is no value.  This
            is due to the fact that statements, such as the assignment statement, do not return a value.  They are simply executed.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of executing the assignment statement is the creation of a reference from a variable, <c>y</c>, to a value, <c>3.14</c>.  When we execute the print function working on <c>y</c>, we see the value that y is referring to.  In fact, evaluating <c>y</c> by itself results in the same response.</p>
 
  <p>In a program, anywhere that a literal value (a string or a number) is acceptable, a more
    complicated expression is also acceptable. Here are all the kinds of expressions we've seen so
    far:</p>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>literal</title>
      <p>e.g., <q>Hello</q> or 3.14</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>variable name</title>
      <p>e.g., x or length</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>operator expression</title>
      <p>&lt;expression&gt; operator-name &lt;expression&gt;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>function call expressions</title>
      <p>&lt;expression&gt;(&lt;expressions separated by commas&gt;)</p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <p>Notice that operator expressions (like <c>+</c> and <c>*</c>) have sub-expressions before and
    after the operator. Each of these can themselves be simple or complex expressions. In that way,
    you can build up to having pretty complicated expressions.</p>
