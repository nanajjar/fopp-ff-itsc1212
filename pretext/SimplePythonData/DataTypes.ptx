  <title>Data Types</title>
  <p>If you are not sure what class (data type) a value falls into, Python has a function called
            <term>type</term> which can tell you.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(type("Hello, World!"))
print(type(17))
print("Hello, World")
print(type(3.2))
        </input>
  </program>

  <p>Not surprisingly, strings belong to the class <term>str</term> and integers belong to the class <term>
    int</term>.</p>
  <note>
    <p>When we show the value of a string using the <c>print</c> function, such as in the third
      example above, the quotes are not present in the output. The value of the string is the
      sequence of characters inside the quotes. The quotes are only necessary to help Python know
      what the value is.</p>
  </note>

  <p>In programming, a function is a subroutine, designed to perform a specific task. When you
    "call" a function, you're asking it to execute its task. Functions can take in information,
    known as arguments, work with that information, and then often return a result. For example, <em>
    print()</em> is a function which takes in a single string argument between the parentheses and
    performs the task: Printing the string argument we provided to the terminal.</p>

  <p> Let's take a closer look at the print statements above. <pre>print(type("Hello, World!"))</pre> What we have here is a
    function call inside a function call. In most, if not all programming languages, when you have a
    function call inside another function call, the following steps are taken: <ol>
      <li> Start by evaluating the function call(s) that are the most deeply nested. Process any
    arguments and return their results</li>
      <li>
        Continue this process, passing results from each function call to the next level up, until
    you reach the outermost function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Perform the operation of the outermost function with the final result from the previous
    step.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Going back to the examples, we first call the type() function with the argument "Hello, World!". The type() function
    returns the data type of the given value. In this case, "Hello, World!" is a string, so
    type("Hello, World!") will return &lt; class 'str' &gt;, indicating that the value is of type
    str (short for string). The print() function then outputs this result to the console, so when
    you run this line, you'll see &lt; class 'str' &gt;. print(type(17)): Similarly, this line calls
    the type() function with the argument 17. Since 17 is an integer, type(17) will return &lt;
    class 'int' &gt;, indicating that the value is of type int (short for integer). The print()
    function then outputs this result to the console, so running this line will display &lt; class
    'int' &gt;. </p>

  <!-- <p> You will get more familiar with functions (and design your own functions!) in the following
    weeks. -->
    <p>
   Don't worry if this seems challenging. As we progress in the course you'll get more familiar with functions and even design your own!
   
     Each new concept and challenge is a chance to develop your problem-solving skills and enhance your programming abilities. 
      Every mistake and difficulty is a valuable part of the learning process. Stay engaged and keep asking questions.

  <p>What about values like <c>"17"</c> and <c>"3.2"</c>? They look like numbers, but they
            are in quotation marks like strings.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(type("17"))
print(type("3.2"))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>They're strings!</p>
  <p>Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (<c>'</c>) or double
            quotes (<c>"</c>), or three of each (<c>'''</c> or <c>"""</c>)</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(type('This is a string.'))
print(type("And so is this."))
print(type("""and this."""))
print(type('''and even this...'''))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Double quoted strings can contain single quotes inside them, as in <c>"Bruce's
beard"</c>, and single quoted strings can have double quotes inside them, as in
            <c>'The knights who say "Ni!"'</c>.
            Strings enclosed with three occurrences of either quote symbol are called
            triple quoted strings.  They can contain either single or double quotes:</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print('''"Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"''')
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Triple quoted strings can even span multiple lines:</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print("""This message will span
several lines
of the text.""")
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Python doesn't care whether you use single or double quotes or the
            three-of-a-kind quotes to surround your strings.  Once it has parsed the text of
            your program or command, the way it stores the value is identical in all cases,
            and the surrounding quotes are not part of the value.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print('This is a string.')
print("""And so is this.""")
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>So the Python language designers usually chose to surround their strings by
            single quotes.  What do you think would happen if the string already contained
            single quotes?</p>
  <p>When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between
            groups of three digits, as in <c>42,000</c>. This is not a legal integer in
            Python, but it does mean something else, which is legal:</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_7" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(42500)
print(42,500)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Well, that's not what we expected at all! Because of the comma, Python chose to
            treat this as a <em>pair</em> of values. In fact, a print statement can print any number of values as long
            as you separate them by commas. Notice that the values are separated by spaces when they are displayed.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_5_8" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(42, 17, 56, 34, 11, 4.35, 32)
print(3.4, "hello", 45)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Remember not to put commas or spaces in your integers, no
            matter how big they are. Also revisit what we said in the previous chapter:
            formal languages are strict, the notation is concise, and even the smallest
            change might mean something quite different from what you intended.</p>
  <note>
    <p>The examples in this online text describe how print works in Python 3. If you install Python 2.7 on your machine, it will work slightly differently. One difference is that print is not called as a function, so there are no parentheses around the values to be printed.</p>
