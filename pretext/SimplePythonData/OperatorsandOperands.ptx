  <title>Operators and Operands</title>
    <p>
    Expressions don't compute values on their own-they rely on operators and operands to do the work.
    <term>Operators</term> are special tokens that represent computations like addition,
            multiplication and division. The values the operator works on are called
    <term>operands</term>. 
  </p>
  <p>An expression combines operands and operators to produce a single value. The following are all legal Python expressions whose meaning is more or less
            clear:</p>
  <pre>20 + 32
hour - 1
hour * 60 + minute
minute / 60
5 ** 2
(5 + 9) * (15 - 7)</pre>

<p> Python uses special <c>characters</c> called <c>operators</c> that perform the following operations: </p>
<ul> 
<li> <c> + </c> addition </li>
<li> <c> - </c> subtraction </li>
<li> <c> * </c> multiplication </li>
<li> <c> / </c> division </li>
<li> <c> ** </c> exponentiation </li>
<li> <c> () </c> grouping </li>
<li> <c> // </c> integer division (round down division) </li>
<li> <c> % </c> modulo (remainder) </li>
</ul>

<p> There are several other operators that we will learn in future chapters. But these are the ones that you're going to need more or less all of your assignments! </p>
<p>The tokens <c>+</c>, <c>-</c>, and <c>*</c>, and the use of parentheses for grouping,
            mean in Python what they mean in mathematics. The asterisk (<c>*</c>) is the
            token for multiplication, and <c>**</c> is the token for exponentiation.
            Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation all do what you
            expect.</p>
  <p>Remember that if we want to see the results of the computation, the program needs to specify that with the word <c>print</c>. The first three computations occur, but their results are not printed out.</p>


  <program xml:id="ac_statementsAndExpressions_3" label="ac_statementsAndExpressions_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
20 + 32
5 ** 2
(5 + 9) * (15 - 7)
print(2 + 3)   # Addition operator, expected result is 5
print(2 - 3)   # Subtraction operator, expected result is -1
print(2 * 3)   # Multiplication operator, expected result is 6
print(5 / 3)   # Division operator, expected result is 1.6666666666666666
print(3 ** 2)  # Exponentiation operator, expected result is 9
print(3*(2+4)) # Grouping operator, changes the precedence expected result is 18 
    </input>
  </program>

<p> So the first six operators have functionality that you're pretty familiar with! On the other hand, we have two more operators that are used frequently in programming but not that much in math classes.
These are integer division, and modulo. </p>

<p> In the previous example <c> 5 / 3 </c> resulted <c> 1.66666666 </c>. 
In Python 3, which we will be using, the division operator <c>/</c> produces a floating point result
 (even if the result is an integer; <c>4/2</c> is <c>2.0)</c>. 
If you want truncated division, which ignores the remainder, you can use the <c>//</c> operator (for example, 5//2 is 2).

<term>Integer division</term>, or the <c> // </c> operator, divides the number, but rounds it down to the nearest integer. So for the previous example, <c> 5 // 3 </c> will result <c> 1 </c> </p>

<!-- <p>The <term>modulo operator</term>, <c> % </c> yields
            the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second (that's why you can also remember it as remainder operator). For example, <c> 5 % 3 </c> will result <c> 2 </c> as   <c> 5 = 3 * 1 + 2 </c>.  </p> -->

 
 <program xml:id="ac2_3_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(9 / 5) # Integer division operator, expected result is 1.8
print(5 / 9) # Integer division operator, expected result is 0.5555555555555556
print(9 // 5) # Integer division operator, expected result is 1
print(5 // 9) # Integer division operator, expected result is 0

        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Pay particular attention to the examples above. Note that <c>9//5</c> truncates rather than rounding, so it produces the value 1 rather 2.</p>
 
<p>The truncated division operator, <c>//</c>, also works on floating point numbers. It truncates to the nearest integer, but still produces a floating point result. Thus <c>7.0 // 3.0</c> is <c>2.0</c>.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_3_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(7.0 / 3.0)
print(7.0 // 3.0)
        </input>
  </program>

            <!-- <program xml:id="ac_statementsAndExpressions_4" label="ac_statementsAndExpressions_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(5//3) # Integer division operator, expected result is 1
print(60//7) # Integer division operator, expected result is 8
print(50//2) # Integer division operator works same as division operator when the result is integer

print(5%3) # Modulo operator, expected result is 2
print(60%7) # Modulo operator, expected result is 4
print(4%2) # Modulo operator, expected result is 0
    </input>
  </program> -->

   <p xml:id="simple-python-data_index-1">When a variable name appears in place of an operand, 
   python substitutes that variable name with its assigned value. For example, what if we wanted to convert 645 minutes into hours?
           </p>
  <program xml:id="ac_statementsAndExpressions_5" label="ac_statementsAndExpressions_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
minutes = 645
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
    </input>
  </program>
 
 <p xml:id="simple-python-data_modulus-operator">The <term>modulus operator</term>, sometimes also called the <term>remainder operator</term> or <term>integer remainder operator</term> works on integers (and integer expressions) and yields
            the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second. In Python, the
            modulus operator is a percent sign (<c>%</c>). The syntax is the same as for other
            operators.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac2_3_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(7 // 3)    # This is the integer division operator
print(7 % 3)     # This is the remainder or modulus operator
print(3 % 7)     # If we try to find the remainder of an integer smaller than the divisor the result is the integer itself

        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In the above example, 7 divided by 3 is 2 when we use integer division and there is a remainder of 1.</p>
  <p>The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can
            check whether one number is divisible by another&#x2014;if <c>x % y</c> is zero, then
            <c>x</c> is divisible by <c>y</c>.
            Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number.  For
            example, <c>x % 10</c> yields the right-most digit of <c>x</c> (in base 10).
            Similarly <c>x % 100</c> yields the last two digits.</p>

 <p>The remainder operator is also extremely useful for doing conversions, say from seconds,
            to hours, minutes and seconds.
            If we start with a number of seconds, say 7684, the following program uses integer division and remainder to convert to an easier form.  Step through it to be sure you understand how the division and remainder operators are being used to
            compute the correct values.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_statementsAndExpressions_6" label="ac_statementsAndExpressions_6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
          total_secs = 7684
          hours = total_secs // 3600
          secs_still_remaining = total_secs % 3600
          minutes =  secs_still_remaining // 60
          secs_finally_remaining = secs_still_remaining  % 60
    </input>
  </program>
