  <title>Input</title>
  <!--<video

  <p> The program in section <xref ref="simple-python-data_operators-and-operands" /> for conversion
    from seconds, to hours, minutes and seconds demonstrated how to use the print function to
    produce output. The program in the previous section works fine but is very limited in that it
    only works with one value for <c>total_secs</c>. What if we wanted to rewrite the program so
    that it was more general. One thing we could do is allow the user to enter any value they wish
    for the number of seconds. The program could then print the proper result for that starting
    value.</p>
  <p>In order to do this, we need a way to get <term>input</term> from the user. Luckily, in Python
    there is a built-in function to accomplish this task. As you might expect, it is called <c>input</c>
    .</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
      n = input("Please enter your name: ")
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>The input function allows the user to provide a <term>prompt string</term>. When the function
    is evaluated, the prompt is shown. The user of the program can enter the name and press <title_reference>
    return</title_reference>. When this happens the text that has been entered is returned from the <title_reference>
    input</title_reference> function, and in this case assigned to the variable <title_reference>n</title_reference>.
    Make sure you run this example a number of times and try some different names in the input box
    that appears.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_input_1" label="ac_input_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      n = input("Please enter your name: ")
      print("Hello", n)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>It is very important to note that the <c>input</c> function <strong>always</strong> returns a
    string value. Even if you asked the user to enter their age, you would get back a string like <c>
    "17"</c>.</p>

  <p>For example, enter the characters<em>17</em> or any integer as the input in the code block
    below and see its type</p>

  <program xml:id="ac_input_2" label="ac_input_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      m = input("Please enter 17 or any integer: ")
      print(m)
      print(type(m))
    </input>
  </program>
  <!-- <p>As seen above, even though an integer was given as the input, it was converted into a
  string. 
    It would be your job, as the programmer, to convert that string into
            an int or a float, using the <c>int</c> or <c>float</c> converter function.
  </p> -->

    <title>Type conversion functions</title>

    <p>Variables have
      types; again, we can ask the interpreter what they are.</p>
<program xml:id="ac_input_3" label="ac_input_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
<input>
message = "What's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14159

print(type(message))
print(type(n))
print(type(pi))
</input>
</program>
<p>The type of a variable is the type of the object it currently refers to.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it is necessary to convert values from one type to another.  Python provides
      a few simple functions that will allow us to do that.  The functions <c>int</c>, <c>float</c> and
  <c>str</c>
      will (attempt to) convert their arguments into types <title_reference>int</title_reference>,
  <title_reference>float</title_reference> and <title_reference>str</title_reference>
      respectively.  We call these <term>type conversion</term> functions.</p>
<p>The <c>int</c> function can take a floating point number or a string, and turn it
      into an int. For floating point numbers, it <em>discards</em> the decimal portion of
      the number - a process we call <em>truncation towards zero</em> on the number line.
      Let us see this in action:</p>

      <program xml:id="ac_input_4" label="ac_input_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
          print(3.14)
          print(int(3.14))
            </input>
      </program>

      <p>
        Using int() on a float removes the decimal part, essentially "rounding down" to the nearest whole
  number. 
        This can be useful when you only need the integer part of a float, 
        but remember that it doesn't round to the nearest integer—it simply drops the decimal part.
      </p>
      <program xml:id="ac_input_5" label="ac_input_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
          print(3.9999)
          print(int(3.9999))       # This doesn't round to the closest int!
            </input>
      </program>

      <program xml:id="ac_input_6" label="ac_input_6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
          print(3.0)
          print(int(3.0))
            </input>
      </program>
<p>
  When using int() on a float with no decimal part other than .0 (like 3.0 ), Python simply returns
  the integer value without any fractional part. 
  This conversion is straightforward because there's no rounding or truncation needed.
</p>
<p>Along the same lines, when converting a negative float to an integer truncation moves towards
  zero, so -3.999 becomes -3. 
</p>
      <program xml:id="ac_input_7" label="ac_input_7" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
          print(-3.999)
          print(int(-3.999))        # Note that the result is closer to zero
            </input>
      </program>
      
        <p>
         The int() function is can also be used to convert strings containing numeric characters (like
  "2345") into actual integers. 
         This is essential when we want to work with numeric data that's initially in string form, such as
  data from user input, text files, or databases.
        </p>
      <program xml:id="ac_input_8" label="ac_input_8" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
          print("2345")
          print(int("2345"))        # parse a string to produce an int
            </input>
      </program>

      <p>
        In this example, we see the difference between a string representation of a number and an integer
  (int) representation of a number. Here, "2345" is a string because it's enclosed in quotation
  marks. Earlier we have seen that when we use print("2345"), Python outputs it as text.
        Even though the characters are numeric, Python still considers it as text (a sequence of
  characters) rather than a number.
       In the Second Line (<c>print(int("2345"))</c>), the int() function converts (or "parses") the
  string "2345" into an integer value. 
          This means Python will interpret "2345" as a numeric value, rather than as text.
          int("2345") takes the string version and produces the integer 2345, which allows us to perform
  arithmetic operations (calculations) with it if needed.
          
      </p>
      <p>
        When you pass an integer to int(), it will simply return the integer as it is, without any change.
      </p>
      <program xml:id="ac_input_9" label="ac_input_9" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
          print(17)
          print(int(17))               # int even works on integers
            </input>
      </program>
      <p> This last case shows that a string has to be a syntactically legal number,
        otherwise you'll get one of those pesky runtime errors.  
        Modify the example by deleting the
        <c>bottles</c> and rerun the program.  You should see the integer <c>23</c>.</p>
      <program xml:id="ac_input_10" label="ac_input_10" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
    print(int("23bottles"))
            </input>
      </program>

      <p>The type converter <c>float</c> can turn an integer, a float, or a syntactically
        legal string into a float.</p>  
<program xml:id="ac_input_11" label="ac_input_11" interactive="activecode" language="python">
<input>
print(float("123.45"))
print(type(float("123.45")))
    </input>
</program>
<p>The type converter <c>str</c> turns its argument into a string.  Remember that when we print a
  string, the
        quotes are removed.  However, if we print the type, we can see that it is definitely
  <title_reference>str</title_reference>.</p>
<program xml:id="ac_input_12" label="ac_input_12" interactive="activecode" language="python">
<input>
print(str(17))
print(str(123.45))
print(type(str(123.45)))
    </input>
</program>

  <p> As shown above, even though an integer was entered, the value stored in <code>m</code> is a
    string. Because of this, the value cannot be used directly in numeric calculations. </p>

  <p> To use the input as a number, the string must be converted to a numeric type. Python provides
    built-in conversion functions such as <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> for this purpose. </p>

  <program>
    <input language="python" interactive="activecode">
      m = input("Please enter your age: ")
      age = int(m)
      print(age)
      print(type(age))
    </input>
  </program>

  <p> After conversion, the value stored in <code>age</code> is an integer and can be used in
    calculations. </p>

  <program language="python">
    <input>
      print(age + 1)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p> If the input may contain a decimal value, the <code>float</code> function can be used instead. </p>

  <program>
    <input language="python" interactive="activecode">
      height = float(input("Please enter your height in meters: "))
      print(height * 2)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    As the programmer, it is your responsibility to choose the appropriate type
    conversion based on how the input value will be used. Understanding when and how to
    convert input values is essential for writing correct programs and avoiding
    type-related errors.
  </p>
  <p>
     Here is another example of a program that turns a number of seconds into more human readable
    counts of hours, minutes, and seconds. A call to <c>input()</c> allows the user to enter the
    number of seconds. Then we convert that string to an integer. From there we use the division and
    modulus operators to compute the results. 
  </p>
  <program xml:id="ac_input_13" label="ac_input_13" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      str_seconds = input("Please enter the number of seconds you wish to convert")
      total_secs = int(str_seconds)

      hours = total_secs // 3600
      secs_still_remaining = total_secs % 3600
      minutes = secs_still_remaining // 60
      secs_finally_remaining = secs_still_remaining % 60

      print("Hrs=", hours, "mins=", minutes, "secs=", secs_finally_remaining)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>
    The variable <c>str_seconds</c> will refer to the string that is entered by the user. As we
    said above, even though this string may be <c>7684</c>, it is still a string and not a number.
    To convert it to an integer, we use the <c>int</c> function. The result is referred to by <c>
    total_secs</c>. Now, each time you run the program, you can enter a new value for the number of
    seconds to be converted.
