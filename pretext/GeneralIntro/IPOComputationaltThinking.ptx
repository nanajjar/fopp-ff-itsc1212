    <title>Computational Thinking Through the IPO Lens</title>

  <p>
    The IPO model also supports the development of
    <term>computational thinking</term>, a collection of problem-solving skills that
    guide how programs are designed and reasoned about.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Decomposition</em> involves breaking a problem into smaller pieces. Large
    problems can often be decomposed into smaller IPO units, each with its own inputs,
    processing steps, and outputs. Functions are a common way to represent these units.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Abstraction</em> focuses attention on what a component does rather than how it
    does it. By describing a function in terms of its inputs and outputs, the details
    of the process can be temporarily hidden, allowing the program to be understood at
    a higher level.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Pattern recognition</em> helps identify similarities across problems. Many tasks,
    such as data analysis, unit conversion, or simulation, share common IPO structures.
    Recognizing these patterns makes it easier to reuse ideas and solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Algorithmic thinking</em> is most visible in the <em>process</em> part of IPO.
    It involves defining clear, ordered steps that transform inputs into outputs.
    Tracing execution and debugging both rely on understanding how these steps are
    carried out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Connecting computational problem solving to the IPO model provides a consistent
    framework for designing programs, tracing execution, and debugging errors.
    Throughout this course, the IPO model will be used—sometimes explicitly and
    sometimes implicitly—to support problem solving and reasoning about code.
