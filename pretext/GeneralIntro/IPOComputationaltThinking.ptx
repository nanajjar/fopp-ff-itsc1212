    <title>Computational Thinking and IPO</title>

 <p>
    Earlier in the course, we introduced <term>computational thinking</term> as a set of
    problem-solving skills that help you design programs and understand how they work.
    The <term>Input-Process-Output (IPO)</term> model gives you a simple and practical way
    to apply those skills when working through programming problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    One key computational thinking skill is <em>decomposition</em>. Using IPO makes this
    easier by encouraging you to break a large problem into smaller pieces, each with
    its own inputs, processing steps, and outputs. These smaller pieces often become
    functions in your programs.
  </p>

    <p>
    <em>Abstraction</em> is about focusing on the big picture instead of every detail.
    When you describe a part of a program using only its inputs and outputs, you can
    understand what it does without worrying about how it works internally.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Pattern recognition</em> develops as you solve more problems. You may notice that
    many tasks—such as converting units, analyzing data, or running simulations—follow
    similar IPO patterns. Recognizing these patterns can save time and make problem
    solving easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Algorithmic thinking</em> shows up most clearly in the <em>process</em> part of IPO.
    This is where you decide the order of steps needed to turn inputs into outputs.
    Tracing program execution and debugging both rely on understanding these steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    By connecting computational thinking to the IPO model, you gain a consistent way to
    plan programs, follow how they run, and figure out what went wrong when something does
    not work as expected. Throughout this course, IPO will continue to serve as a helpful
    guide for solving problems, even when we are not explicitly talking about it.
