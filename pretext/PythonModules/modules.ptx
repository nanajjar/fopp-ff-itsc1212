<p> A <term>module</term> is a file containing Python definitions and
  statements intended for use in other Python programs. There are many modules that come with Python
  as part of the <term>standard library</term>. Using modules allows you to access additional
  functionality without having to write everything yourself, and it helps keep programs organized by
  grouping related code together. </p> 
  <p>To use the code inside a module, we must first import it.
  Importing a module makes its contents available to our program under a specific name. </p>
<program
    xml:id="ac_modules_0" label="ac_modules_0" language="python">
    <input>
      import math   # allows us to use the math library providing mathematical functions (square roots, logarithms, factorials, constants)
      import random # allows us to use the random library to generate random numbers and make random choices
      import time   # allows us to use the time library to measure elapsed time and pause program execution
      import os     # allows us to use the os library to interact with the operating system (files, folders, environment)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    This statement creates new names (math, random, time, os), that refers to a module object.
    You can think of this as telling Python where to look when you want to use something defined in
  one of those modules.
  </p>
  <p>
  Once a module has been imported, the names it contains do not become part of your program's main
  namespace.
    Instead, they remain inside the module's own namespace.
    A namespace is simply a space in which all names are distinct from one another.
    The same name can exist in different namespaces, but two objects cannot share the same name
  within a single namespace.
  </p>
<p>
  A familiar example of a namespace is the folder structure on your computer.
    Within a single folder, each file must have a unique name.
    However, you can have files with the same name in different folders because each folder defines
  its own namespace.
    Python modules work in a similar way: each module acts like its own folder, containing names
    that are distinct within that module.
  </p>
  <p>
  Another example of a namespace is the set of street names within a city.
    Many cities have a street called Main Street, but it would be confusing if two streets in the
  same city had the same name.
    In contrast, human names are not managed by a system that enforces uniqueness, which is why
  governments assign unique identifiers, such as a social security number or passport number.
  </p>


<p>
  Now that we have introduced what modules are and why they are useful, let's look at one commonly used module that comes with Python. 
  The math module is part of Python's standard library and provides functions for many familiar mathematical operations.
</p>
  <p>
    Here'san example of importing the <c>math</c> module and how we can use some the things that are defined
  inside.
</p>

  <program xml:id="ac_modules_1" label="ac_modules_1" interactive="activecode"
    language="python">
    <input>
      import math # allows us to use the math library

      print(math.factorial(10)) # prints 10!
      print(math.exp(4)) # prints e^4

      print(math.log2(1024)) # prints log2(1024)
      print(math.sqrt(100)) # prints the square root of 100
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>Here
  we are using <c>factorial</c>, <c>exp</c>, <c>log2</c>, and <c>sqrt</c>, all of which are defined
  inside the <c>math</c> module.</p>
  <p>But what if no one had told us about math? How would we know
  that it exists. How would we know what it can do for us? The answer is to ask for help and the
    best place to get
    help about the Python programming environment is to consult with the Python Documentation.</p>
  <p>
  The <url href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/" visual="http://docs.python.org/py3k/">Python
  Documentation</url> site for Python version 3 (the home page is shown below) is an extremely
  useful reference for all aspects of Python. The site contains a listing of all the standard
  modules that are available with Python (see <url
      href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/py-modindex.html"
      visual="http://docs.python.org/py3k/py-modindex.html">Global Module Index</url>). You will
  also see that there is a <url href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/index.html"
      visual="http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/index.html">Language Reference</url> and a <url
      href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/index.html"
      visual="http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/index.html">Tutorial</url> (mostly aimed at
  people who are already familiar with another programming language), as well as installation
  instructions, how-tos, and frequently asked questions. We encourage you to become familiar with
  this site and to use it often.</p>

  <p>If you have not done so already, take a look at the Global Module Index. Here
  you will see an
    alphabetical listing of all
    the modules that are available as part of the standard library. Find the math module.</p>
  <image
    source="PythonModules/Figures/moduleindexmedium.png" width="50%" />
  <p>You can see that all the
  math functionality that we have talked about is there. However, there
    is so much more.
    Take some time to read through and familiarize yourself with some of the other things that math
  can do.</p>


  <p> In order to use Python modules, you have to import them into a Python program. That
  happens with an import statement: the word <c>import</c>, and then the name of the module. The
  name is case-sensitive. Roughly translated to English, an import statement says "there's some code
  in another file; please make its functions and variables available in this file." More
  technically, an import statement causes all the code in another file to be executed. Any variables
  that are bound during that execution (including functions that are defined) may then be referred
  in some way (to be discussed) in the current file. By convention, all <c>import</c> commands are
  put at the very top of your file. They can be put elsewhere, but that can lead to some confusions,
  so it's best to follow the convention. Where do these other files that you can import come from?
  It could be a code file that you wrote yourself, or it could be code that someone else wrote and
  you copied on to your computer. For example, if you have a file <c>myprog.py</c> in directory <c>
  ~/Desktop/mycode/</c>, and <c>myprog.py</c> contains a line of code <c>import morecode</c>, then
  the python interpreter will look for a file called <c>morecode.py</c>, excecute its code, and make
  its object bindings available for reference in the rest of the code in <c>myprog.py</c>. </p>
  <p>Note
  that it is <c>import morecode</c>, not <c>import morecode.py</c>, but the other file has to be
  called <c>morecode.py</c>.</p>

  <p>The tests you see in your problem sets are also using a Python
  module that's in the standard library, called <c>unittest</c>. Right now, you can't see the code
  that causes those tests to run, because we have hidden it from you, as you progress in learning
  how to program, you will learn how to write your own Unit Tests for code, and to do so, you will
  need to write an import statement at the beginning of your programs. Even before you learn how to
  write your own tests, you will see code for Unit Tests in your problem set files. </p>

  <note>

    <title>Don't overwrite standard library modules!</title>

    <p>Given the order of search for external Python modules that is described in the list above, it
  is possible to overwrite a standard library. For example, if you create a file <c>random.py</c> in
  the same directory where <c>myprog.py</c> lives, and then <c>myprog.py</c> invokes <c>import
        random</c>, it will import your file rather than the standard library module. That's not
  usually what you want, so be careful about how you name your python files! </p>
