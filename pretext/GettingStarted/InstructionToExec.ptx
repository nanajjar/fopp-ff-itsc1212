  <title> From Instructions to Execution</title>

  <p>

    <term>Programming languages</term> are the tools that allow humans to communicate instructions to computers. 
    These languages provide a set of syntax and semantics that define how to write commands that a computer can understand and execute. 
    </p><p> Python, C++, PHP, and Java are examples
            of  <term>high-level programming languages</term>. As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also
            <term>low-level languages</term>, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly
            languages. Machine language is the encoding of instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the computer.  Assembly language uses a slightly easier format to refer to the low level instructions.
            Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in
            low-level languages.  To be exact, computers can actually only execute programs written in machine language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language (and even those in assembly language) have to be
            processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is
            a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
            However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.</p>
  <p>First, it is much easier to program in a
            high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time
            to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be
            correct. Second, high-level languages are <term>portable</term>, meaning that they can
            run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level
            programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run
            on another.</p>
  <p>Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level
            languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized
            applications.</p>
  <p>Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:
            <term>interpreters</term> and <term>compilers</term>. An interpreter reads a high-level program
            and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the
            program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing
            computations.</p>

  <p>A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program
            starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the <term>source
                code</term>, and the translated program is called the <term>object code</term> or the
            <term>executable</term>. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly
            without further translation.</p>

        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    High and low have nothing to do with the type of device you are programming for.  Instead, look at what it takes to run the program written in the language.

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>It is high-level if the program must be processed before it can run, and low-level if the computer can execute it without additional processing.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    Python is a high level language but must be interpreted into machine code (binary) before it can be executed.

                    While it is true that it is generally easier to program in a high-level language and programs written in a high-level language are usually shorter, this is not always the case.
