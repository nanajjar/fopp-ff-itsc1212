    <title>Code Style</title>
    <p>Good coding style is crucial to maintain elegant code and to not confuse yourself. For example,
    using non-descriptive variable names such as x, y, or z or using multiple variables of similar names will make
    the code harder to read and understand for others, and may confuse you in the process. As the programs you write
    become larger and larger, this becomes even more important. Take this example:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac_codeStyle_1" label="ac_codeStyle_1" language="python" interactive="activecode">
        <input>
        x = input("Enter your first name: ")
        y = input("Enter your last name: ")

        z = x + " " + y # add space between first and last name
        print(z)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>Here, the program runs and works properly, but the style could use some attention. The variable names are
    x, y, and z. They are not very descriptive of what values the variables are holding, more suitable variable names
    could be first_name, last_name, and full_name. These variable names are more descriptive and accurately relay what values the variables
    are holding. </p>
    <program xml:id="ac_codeStyle_2" label="ac_codeStyle_2" language="python" interactive="activecode">
        <input>
        first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
        last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")

        full_name = first_name + " " + last_name # add space between first and last name
        print(full_name)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>Now the variable names make more sense. It's clear to others what values the variable names have. If the program
    were more complex with tens of variables and a lot going on, it would still be clear what they are. This concept of 
    code style does not only apply to variables though, it applies to each and every part. For example, if the lines that
    retrieved user input were blank (i.e., input() instead of input("Enter first name: ")), only the programmer would know
    what to enter. As you code and your programs become more complex, this will be crucial to maintaining readable code that others
    can easily interpret.</p>
