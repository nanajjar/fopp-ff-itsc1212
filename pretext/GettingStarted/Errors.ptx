    <title>Types of Errors</title>

    <p>Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: <url
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error"
      visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error">syntax errors</url>, <url
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error"

      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error"
      visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic errors</url>.  <term>Syntax errors</term> are mistakes that violate the rules of the Python programming language. <term>Runtime errors</term> occur when your code is valid, but tries to do something that is impossible at the time the code is run (like divide by zero, or multiply two string variables together). <term>Semantic errors</term> occur when the program runs successfully but doesn't produce the correct output, because the program that was written does not correctly solve the problem as intended. The following sections will describe these three types of errors in more detail.</p>


    <subsection>
    <title>Syntax errors</title>
  <p>Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct;
            otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message.  <term>Syntax</term> refers
            to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example,
            in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
            this sentence contains a <term>syntax error</term>. So does this one</p>
  <p>For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is
            why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without problems.
            Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your
            program, Python will display an error message and quit.  You will not be able
            to complete the execution of your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you
            will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. However, as you gain
            experience, you will make fewer errors and you will also be able to find your errors faster.</p>

        <feedback>
                    A syntax error is an error in the structure of the python code that can be detected before the program is executed.   Python cannot usually tell if you are trying to divide by 0 until it is executing your program (e.g., you might be asking the user for a value and then dividing by that value - you cannot know what value the user will enter before you run the program).

                    This is a problem with the formal structure of the program.  Python knows where colons are required and can detect when one is missing simply by looking at the code without running it.

                    This will produce the wrong answer, but Python will not consider it an error at all.  The programmer is the one who understands that the answer produced is wrong.

    <subsection>
    <title>Runtime Errors</title>
  <p>The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does
            not appear until you run the program. These errors are also called
            <term>exceptions</term> because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and
            bad) has happened.</p>
  <p>Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few
            chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.</p>

    <title>Semantic Errors</title>
  <p>The third type of error is the <term>semantic error</term>. If there is a semantic error
            in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will
            not generate any error messages.  However, your program will not do the right thing. It will do
            something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.</p>
  <p>The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to
            write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong.  Identifying
            semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by
            looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.</p>

                    A semantic error is an error in logic. In this case the program does not produce the correct output because the problem is not solved correctly. This would be considered a run-time error.

                    A semantic error is an error in logic. In this case the program does not produce the correct output because the code can not be processed by the compiler or interpreter. This would be considered a syntax error.
